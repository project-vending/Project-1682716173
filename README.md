#  Cloud-Native Architecture: Design and develop a cloud-native data architecture using Amazon Aurora Serverless for database storage, AWS S3 for data lake ingestion, AWS ElasticSearch for searching and querying, AWS Lambda for processing, and Fast API for data serving. Utilize Streamlit to build an interactive user interface that allows for data exploration, analysis, modeling, and testing. Finally, incorporate Great Expectations for automated data validations at every step of the data pipeline.
